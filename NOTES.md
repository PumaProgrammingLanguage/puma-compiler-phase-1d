General notes

Recent updates

- Invalid implicit conversion validation now rejects incompatible assignments for property-to-property, property-to-local, local-to-property, and local-to-local cases.
- `InvalidImplicitConvertionTest` was expanded and is currently passing after parser updates.
- Added compiler-module coverage for invalid implicit conversions in non-assignment contexts (return statements, function-call arguments, and conditional expressions), and parser validation now rejects those invalid implicit conversions.
- Added integer-width boundary-value compiler-module test coverage (min/max literals for uint8/uint16/uint32/uint64 and int8/int16/int32/int64) with full codegen output assertions.
- Added floating boundary-value compiler-module test coverage with precision-sensitive flt32/flt64 exponent literals and codegen output assertions.

Unit test TODO list

- Add regression tests that validate implicit/explicit conversion error message consistency across sections (start, initialize, functions).
- Add tests for mixed-expression conversion behavior (binary operations with differing numeric types) and assert generated expression output.
