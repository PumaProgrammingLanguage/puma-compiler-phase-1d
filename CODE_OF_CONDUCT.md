Puma Programming Language Project
Code of Conduct

The Puma Programming Language Project’s Code of Conduct is based on the Linux Foundation’s Code of Conduct.  The Puma project committee may add and/or modify this Code of Conduct as needed.  

Code of Conduct
1.	Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
2.	Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically or sexually.
3.	Never discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
4.	Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning behavior or language.
5.	Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge properly the contributions of others.
6.	Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.
7.	Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access.
8.	With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or unwelcome behavior or advances.
9.	Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.
10.	Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people.
11.	Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.
